Certain database schema is normalized when there is no repeating data in it.

The advantages are:
-The database does not have redundant data, it is smaller in size so less money needs to be spent on storage
-Because there is less data to search through, it is much faster to run a query on the data
-Because there is no data duplication there is better data integrity and less risk of mistakes
-Because there is no data duplication there is less chance of storing two or more different copies of the data
-Once change can be made which can instantly be cascaded across any related records.

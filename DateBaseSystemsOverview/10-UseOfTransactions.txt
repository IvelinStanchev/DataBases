You can do transactions when need to rollback every change, if an error occurs or some other reason. For example if Pesho has 500 levas and must give to Gosho 500 levas but at the same time he gives to another person another 500 levas he will have -500 levas. For that reason we must use transactions. So when Gosho gets the 500 levas then the other person will see that Pesho has 0 levas and he cannot get money from Pesho.

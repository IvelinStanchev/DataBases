They might increase the speed of searching of values in a certain column or group of columns 
(usually implemented as B-trees)

If indexes are used, writing to table (for example inserting rows) is
slower, because in addition to just writing the data, MySQL needs to
handle the index file also. This is an issue usually only if you need
very fast inserts or you need to insert thousands of rows at the same
time and fast.
